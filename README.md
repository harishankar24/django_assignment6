DjangoRestFramework: Class based Views + Serializers

Database used: MySQL

Model used: Passenger(firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints)

Performed CRUD operation using serializers.

First class view performs non primary key based operations(Read, Create) & second class view performs primary key based operations(Update, Delete).

## Sample Data

To save time I've kept few records here.

```
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Anne', 'Mizzi', 'amizzic@chicagotribune.com', 79);
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Caleb', 'Thatcham', 'cthatchamd@bandcamp.com', 536);
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Nata', 'Reeder', 'nreedere@spotify.com', 381);
```
